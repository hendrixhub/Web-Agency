# Spring Forward Design by John Hendrix

## A web-agency/portfolio/faq front-end website project created for Code Louisville

This is a HTML and CSS based multi-page, mobile responsive website with a portfolio page.  The FAQ page utilizes javascript/jquery for animation of the FAQ sections.

This website demonstrates mobile responsive design using two CSS media query breakpoints points for phone, tablet, and desktop size displays.

The header features a sticky header for ease of use and ease of navigation on the home page.
